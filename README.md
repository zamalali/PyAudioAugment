## Key Features
- **Noise Addition**: Introduce Gaussian noise into audio files to simulate real-world scenarios, enhancing the dataset's realism.
- **Pitch Shifting**: Modify the pitch of audio files while preserving their duration, enabling exploration of pitch-sensitive models.
- **Time Stretching**: Alter the speed and duration of audio files without impacting pitch, providing insights into temporal variations.
- **Gain Adjustment**: Adjust the volume of audio files to assess model sensitivity to volume fluctuations, enhancing model generalization.

## How It Works
The PyAudioAugment Tool empowers users to transform a limited audio dataset into a vast resource by generating augmented samples through various transformations. By applying diverse augmentations to existing audio files, users can create a rich dataset encompassing a wide range of audio variations. These augmented samples can then be converted into feature vectors, capturing essential audio characteristics, and utilized in a myriad of machine learning use cases, including:

1. **Speech Recognition**: Augmented audio samples enable training robust speech recognition models capable of handling various accents, background noise levels, and speaking rates.

2. **Sound Classification**: Diverse audio datasets facilitate the training of sound classification models capable of accurately identifying a wide range of sounds in different environments.

3. **Music Genre Classification**: Augmented audio samples covering diverse genres, tempos, and instrumentation aid in training music genre classification models with improved accuracy and generalization.

4. **Anomaly Detection**: By augmenting audio samples with various anomalies, models can be trained to detect and classify abnormal sounds in real-time audio streams, crucial for applications such as fault detection and security monitoring.

5. **Speaker Identification**: Augmented audio datasets containing variations in pitch, speed, and background noise enable training robust speaker identification models capable of recognizing speakers under diverse conditions.

## Getting Started
To begin using the PyAudioAugment Tool, follow these simple steps:
